Pledge of Allegiance

I pledge allegiance
to the
sovereign Khalsa
spiritual nation

which shall live
to obey
the Will of God

serve humanity
with love
and peace

and spread
the Radiance of
the Holy Naam

as given by
Guru Nanak
through
Guru Gobind Singh

and embodied in
the Siri Guru
Granth Sahib

so that the
children of
the Khalsa

and all their
generations
to follow

may ever live
in the
Spiritual Sovereignty
of Khalsa.

We are the Khalsa
The mighty mighty
Khalsa

Everywhere we go
People want to know

Who we are
So we tell them

We are the Khalsa
The mighty mighty
Khalsa

Everywhere we go
People want to know

Who we are
So we serve them

Bolay So Nihal
Sat Siri Akal
