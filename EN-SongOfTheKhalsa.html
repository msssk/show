Song of the Khalsa

Many speak of courage.
Speaking cannot give it.
It's in the face of death
that we must live it.

When things are
down and darkest,
that's when we
stand tallest.

Until the last
star falls,
we won't give
an inch at all!

Stand as the Khalsa,
strong as steel,
steady as stone.

Give our lives
to God and Guru,
mind and soul,
breath and bone.

Guru Arjun
gave His Life,
to stand for
what was right.

He was burned
and tortured,
five long days
and nights.

He could have
stopped it
any time,
just by giving in.

His strength
a solid wall,
He never gave
an inch at all!

Sons of
the Khalsa,
remember
those who died.

Stood their ground
until their last breath,
so we who live now,
might live free lives.

A princess is
not royal,
by her birth
or blood inside.

But if her
family's home
is Anandpur Sahib

She'll walk with such
a grace and strength,
the world will
bow in awe.

Until the
mountains fall,
she'll never give
an inch at all!

Daughters of
the Khalsa,
in your strength
our future lies.

Give our children
fearless minds,
to see the world
through the Guru's Eyes.

Baisakhi day
we were thousands,
but only five had
the courage for dying.

Then one brave man,
one flashing sword,
turned us all to lions.

And now we live
His Legacy,
to die before we fall.

And like the five who
answered his call,
we can't turn
back at all.

Stand as the Khalsa,
strong as steel,
steady as stone.

Give our lives
to God and Guru,
mind and soul,
breath and bone.

The Tenth Guru gave
even His Sons,
to give the Khalsa life.

His Words stand
like mountains,
against
the winds of time

That Khalsa will
rule the world,
all will be
safe in its fold.

But if the
Khalsa falls,
there won't be
a world at all!

Stand as the Khalsa,
strong as steel,
steady as stone.

Give our lives
to God and Guru,
mind and soul,
breath and bone.

Many speak of courage.
Speaking cannot give it.
It's in the face of death
that we must live it.

When things are
down and darkest,
that's when we
stand tallest.

Until the last
star falls,
we won't give
an inch at all!

Stand as the Khalsa,
strong as steel,
steady as stone.

Give our lives
to God and Guru,
mind and soul,
breath and bone.

Sons of
the Khalsa,
remember
those who died.

Stood their ground
until their last breath,
so we who live now,
might live free lives.

Daughters of
the Khalsa,
in your strength
our future lies.

Give our children
fearless minds,
to see the world
through the Guru's Eyes.

Stand as the Khalsa,
strong as steel,
steady as stone.

Give our lives
to God and Guru,
mind and soul,
breath and bone.

Mind and soul
are His alone.
